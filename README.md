# Red_Tracker

There are three python files within master:

redtracker.py
slopes.py
colorfilter.py

Of these, redtracker is the main code file that uses the slopes class to draw two straight lines on red.png.
colorfilter.py is a helper that tries the screen color parameter to get the HSV value that best highlights the red color of the stakes.
