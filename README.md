# Red_Tracker

There are three python files within master branch:

redtracker.py
slopes.py
colorfilter.py

Using cv2 and numpy.
Of these, redtracker is the main code file that uses the slopes class to draw two straight lines on red.png.
colorfilter.py is a helper that tries the screen color parameter to get the HSV value that best highlights the red color of the stakes.

General Idea:
The general idea is to create two lines that can connect the red pylons. To do this, I first need to detect the red objects, obtain their coordinates, and then draw contours around them. We start by manually adjusting the HSV parameters of the color filter to obtain the red filter. Next, I detect the red objects in the grayscale image and use contours to outline them. We also filter out smaller, interfering contours.

Next, I proceed to draw the lines. I initially attempted to use the Hough Transform, hoping to obtain lines directly from dense points, but that approach failed. So, I turned to finding lines based on their slopes. However, I noticed that there were some interferences such as red lights and reflections, which were similar in size to the pylons and couldn't be easily filtered out. Therefore, I temporarily set them aside.

After obtaining the slopes of all possible lines between pairs of points, I started thinking about how to filter out unwanted lines. Firstly, I removed shorter line segments to eliminate lines generated by the same pylon but with different points. To address other interference points, I grouped lines with similar slopes together. Additionally, to avoid considering horizontal lines, I used a filter based on the number of line samples, only including lines in consideration if they had a certain number of samples in the same group.

This filtering process resulted in only a few lines that closely matched the red pylons. I then used mathematical methods to remove lines with similar slopes, leaving only two lines that met the requirements.

My thought process was that the challenge lay in creating suitable and accurate filters, whether for the red color, contour, or slope. A better filtering approach could involve using linear regression to integrate points in a region into a single line through mathematical methods. However, considering that there may not be only one lane on the road, dividing the image into left and right regions might not cover all scenarios, so it could be beneficial to dynamically adjust the separation regions based on known road segments.
